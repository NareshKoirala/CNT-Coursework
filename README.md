# CNT Coursework Repository

Welcome to the CNT Coursework Repository! This repository contains sub-repositories for various coursework projects completed as part of the CNT program. Each sub-repository focuses on a distinct project, showcasing skills in embedded systems, process automation, and software development. Below is an overview of the sub-repositories included.

## Sub-Repositories

### 1. nKoirala-Lib
**Description**: This sub-repository contains a custom C library developed for Microcontroller Unit (MCU) programming, specifically tailored for use at NAIT. The library provides reusable functions and utilities to interface with MCU hardware, enabling efficient development of embedded systems applications.

**Key Features**:
- Written in C for compatibility with MCU environments.
- Includes modules for GPIO control, timers, interrupts, and communication protocols (e.g., UART, SPI).
- Designed for portability and ease of integration into NAIT’s MCU-based projects.

**Usage**:
- Clone the repository and include the library in your MCU project.
- Refer to the documentation within the sub-repository for function descriptions and examples.

**Directory**: `./nKoirala-Lib`

### 2. Process-Automation
**Description**: This sub-repository documents the Chemplant lab work, which focuses on programming a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to automate a chemical plant simulation. The project utilizes i-TriLogi software to design and implement ladder logic for process control.

**Key Features**:
- Ladder logic programs developed using i-TriLogi for PLC automation.
- Implements control sequences for valves, pumps, and sensors in a simulated chemical plant.
- Includes documentation of the automation workflow and testing results.

**Usage**:
- Open the `.ld` files in i-TriLogi to view or modify the ladder logic.
- Follow the lab report in the sub-repository for setup and execution instructions.

**Directory**: `./Process-Automation`

### 3. Programming
**Description**: This sub-repository showcases C# programming projects, demonstrating proficiency in object-oriented programming, GUI development, and application design. The projects range from console applications to Windows Forms or WPF applications, highlighting versatile software development skills.

**Key Features**:
- Written in C# using .NET Framework/Core.
- Includes examples of data structures, file I/O, and user interface design.
- Well-documented code with emphasis on clean architecture and best practices.

**Usage**:
- Open the `.sln` files in Visual Studio to explore or run the projects.
- Check the individual project folders for specific READMEs and instructions.

**Directory**: `./Programming`
